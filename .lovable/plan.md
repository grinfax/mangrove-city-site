## Mangrove City VR — Website Recreation

A faithful recreation of the **mangrovecity.webflow.io** site as a single-page React app with smooth scroll-based navigation. The design uses a bold color palette: **cyan/teal** (`#00E5E5`) backgrounds, **dark brown/maroon** for sections, **hot pink** for big headings, and **cream/tan** for the team section.
